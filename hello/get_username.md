**In the terminal you should see a prompt asking for your username on Docker Hub.**

This is going to be stored in the environment variable `$yourname` for use in later commands.

If you don't already have a Docker Hub account, you can sign up for a free account at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).
