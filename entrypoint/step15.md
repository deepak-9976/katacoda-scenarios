Here is a Dockerfile that will build an image based on Alpine, specifying `ls` as the entrypoint.

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">

FROM alpine

ENTRYPOINT ["ls"]

CMD ["/bin"]
</pre>

Build this image.

`docker build -t ls:cmd .`{{execute}}

When you run this image, `ls` will be run by default. You can specify additional parameters at the end of your `docker run` command and they will be appended to the entrypoint:

`docker run -t ls:cmd`{{execute}}

##Â Next step

A good way to think of this is this:

* If your container image is designed to run one executable (all, or nearly all the time) then specify that executable using ENTRYPOINT
* If your container image is designed as a multi-purpose image, you can specify CMD for the default behavior and omit ENTRYPOINT so that it's easy for the user to specify the executable they want to run
